FIXES APPLIED:

1) Default source system title: If no system title is configured, the code now uses an 8-byte zero default to avoid 'invalid system title' errors. Set a proper system title in Meter Security Settings if your meter requires it.

2) AndroidManifest: added USB host feature and INTERNET permission to help with USB serial connectivity.

NOTES:
- The project requires an Android USB-serial driver/library (for example 'com.github.mik3y:usb-serial-for-android') to be added as a dependency in the app's Gradle build files to enable serial connections. The original project references SerialPort classes which are not included in this repository; to fully enable serial communication, add the appropriate library and request USB permissions at runtime.
- I could not test with an actual meter. These are code-level fixes to avoid the 'invalid system title' error and to declare USB host capability; further work (adding a serial library and runtime permission handling) is necessary to make serial communication work on-device.
